Dartmouth *VoxCast* is a science outreach podcast about big ideas percolating in the Dartmouth College community--and beyond. We decided to use the pdocast medium because it's become increasingly easy to produce and widely distribute content to the masses. A [recent report by Edison Research](http://www.edisonresearch.com/monthly-podcast-consumption-surges-to-more-than-one-in-five-americans/) estimates that about 1 in 5 Americans (57 million people), have listened to a podcast in the past month, and given current trends, that number is likely to grow over time.  

It's our hope that *VoxCast* will serve a key role among Dartmouth's [other outreach initiatives](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~academicoutreach/), providing a continual platform for the wider public to engage with the many exciting threads of research being conducted across campus.
